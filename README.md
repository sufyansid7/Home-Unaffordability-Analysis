## Big Idea:

### Why does homeownership feel more unattainable compared to a couple decades ago? Why should you care?

Gen Z and Millennials are currently affected the most by changes in housing prices as a growing number of people cannot afford to buy homes


### Why we chose this problem:
We chose this problem because of its growing impact on our generation, and so that we could thoroughly analyze it and understand how to deal with it both collectively and individually

## Solution:

Our goal is to identify the key factors that are contributing to this feeling of unaffordability for young Americans within the U.S. Housing market. By examining housing and financial data we hope to determine a general trend in the market and find out if homes are as affordable for current generations as they have been for generations in the past.
We will compare historical trends in homeownership rates, income-to-home-price ratios, and housing cost burdens across generations, in order to assess whether current young Americans face greater challenges entering the housing market compared to prior cohorts.
